##### Web Service Configuration
#####
#####  This configuration would be common to any application that is developed
#####  using the Blackboard Web Services Framework.  For this project, these
#####  properties should be set for BOTH the GradeExtractApp and
#####  SampleExtractApp.
#####

## The server name, ex: blackboard.institution.edu
ws.hostname=b2showcase.blackboard.com

## http or https
ws.protocol=https

## These are the settings for the proxy tool that will be registered when the
## web service client first connects to the Blackboard web services.
##
##  ws.toolVendorId    : A unique "vendor" Id for the tool
##  ws.toolProgramId   : A unique identifier for this tool, ex: SampleGbEx
##  ws.toolPassword    : password for future connections via this tool.  this can
##                       be anything you want; however, it must be changed in the
##                       Blackboard GUI after initially set.
##  ws.toolDescription : Short description of the tool's functionality
##  
ws.toolVendorId=bbdn
ws.toolProgramId=WSGradeExtract
ws.toolPassword=changeme
ws.toolDescription=Sample web service proxy tool that extracts grades from courses.

## This value must be obtained from Blackboard.  In the System Admin panel,
## navigate to:
##   System Admin -> Building Blocks -> Proxy Tools -> Manage Global Properties
## and get the Proxy Tool Registration Password
ws.toolRegistrationPassword=tool-register

## NOTE: after the first registration, you will need to manually log into
## Blackboard and make the tool available (this is a security step). To do so,
## navigate to:
##   System Admin -> Building Blocks -> Proxy Tools
## And edit the setting and set the tool availability to "Yes"

## Tool registration only needs to happen once.  There is nothing wrong with
## leaving this value set to true (default); however, if you would like to
## suppress the warnings after the initial tool registration, set this to false.
ws.registerTool=true

## Axis paths required to run the web service client.  If you followed the
## readme.txt instructions, then the following should be fine:
##   ws.pathToAxisConf=./lib/axis2-1.6.2/conf/axis2.xml
##   ws.pathToAxisLib=./lib/axis2-1.6.2/lib
## Of coure, if you update libraries or reference a different location, just
## make the change here.
ws.pathToAxisConf=./lib/axis2-1.6.2/conf/axis2.xml
ws.pathToAxisLib=./lib/axis2-1.6.2/lib

## Session duration of entire login (in seconds).  This may need to be
## increased depending on how long the web service client is expected to remain
## connected. There is no set default, this value should be explicitly set.
ws.expectedLifeSeconds=3600

## This is a somewhat dubious timeout setting that controls the "additional
## seconds" needed for the web service session.  You shouldn't need it, but if
## you experience timeouts, uncomment this property and increase with
## ws.expectedLifeSeconds.
#ws.extendSessionLifeSeconds=3600

## Timeout of a single method call (in milliseconds).  This may need to be
## increased if you expect a method call to be very long (i.e. very large
## data load). There is no set default, this value should be explicitly set.
ws.clientTimeoutMillis=3600000


#####
##### Sample Extract Configuration
#####
#####  Configuration parameters specific to the SampleExtractApp ONLY
#####

## The course to load as part of the sample extract
sample.courseId="amarillo-101"


#####
##### Grade Extract Application Configuration
#####
#####  Configuration parameters specific to the GradeExtractApp (NOT the sample
#####  extract app also provided with this project).
#####

## Full path to the output file.  This can be set here or provided as the 
## second argument on the command line.  If set to "STDOUT", the output
## will be redirected to standard out.
app.outputFile=./_reports_/report.csv

## Delimiter of data columns.  Default comma.
app.dataDelimiter=,

## Number of courses to process before a batchWaitDelay
app.batchWaitSize=5

## Time in milliseconds to pause between batches.  This may be advisable as
## repeated large requests from the web services could impact system
## performance.  Default -1 which means no delay.
app.batchWaitDelay=1000

## Number of courses to process before the web service client re-authenticates.
## It may be a good idea to set this value to ensure that there are no timeouts.
## Default value of Integer.MAX_VALUE.
app.wsClientBatchSize=50

## Time in milliseconds to pause between web service client re-authentications.
## Default is -1, which means no delay.
app.wsClientBatchDelay=5000

## If true, only the column marked as the "external grade" will be included in
## in the results.  If false (default) then all columns will be included in the
## grade extract.
app.filterOnExternalGrade=false

## Sets the maximum number of courses that will be processed.  Useful for
## testing or timing course batch durations.  Just comment out the property if
## you don't want to enforce a max.
app.maxCourses=5

## If provided, limits the extract to courses that "contain" (ignores case) the
## provide string.  The search results are equivalent to searching contains by
## via the Blackboard System Admin GUI.  Leave the property commented out to
## "load all couress".
app.courseIdContains=BIO
